intro: "The Gran Sasso National Laboratory (LNGS) hosts many of the most advanced astroparticle physics experiments in the world, having made scientific journals' front pages on several occasions. The facilities can be accessed via the Gran Sasso tunnel and are buried below 1400 meters of solid rock, within the Gran Sasso mountain.
<br>
The Gran Sasso Science Institute (GSSI) is a modern institution focusing on astroparticle physics, mathematics and modelling. Its location close to the LNGS offers its members a unique opportunity to access world-class experiments within the mountain. The GSSI has an active PhD programme in Physics and will be displaying some of the work that students do there.
<br>
The National Institute for Nuclear Physics (INFN) is the leading institution for nuclear and subnuclear research in Italy. Frascati laboratories host a number of experiments, ranging from gravitational wave detection to neutrino physics.
<br>
The University of Rome Tor Vergata will host us for the opening cerimony, with talks and sessions about the research performed at the facility.
<br>
During our visits, we will be offered a large number of talks, as in the 2015 edition. In particular, we expect to have overviews of all the major experiments running at the LNGS. The experience can be overwhelming! We will provide further details of our speakers as they become available."
